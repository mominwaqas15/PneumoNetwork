# PneumoNet: Deep Learning for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-rays

<img src="logo.png" alt="PneumoNet Logo" width="500">


PneumoNet is a pioneering deep learning project focused on harnessing the potential of neural networks for accurate and early pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our model analyzes medical images to distinguish between normal cases and those affected by pneumonia, contributing to enhanced patient outcomes and improved healthcare.
